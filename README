A simple command that generates a key from a file and a passphrase.

file2key uses Keccak[] to create a hash as big as a selected file
and the prints the bitwise exclusive or of the hash and the file
making a keyfile from any normal file and a passphrase. The idea
is the reversed of steganography.

file2key cannot be configured. The idea behind this is that you
if it required configurations you run the risk of losing all your
keys if you lose your configurations. This must not happen.

file2key can also be used to encrypt and decrypt files.
